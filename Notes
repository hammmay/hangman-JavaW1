HANGMAN:

- word is chosen - program must choose word randomly from an array of words
- display the placements of letters for each word like “_ _ _ _”

———

- WHILE hidden fields remain OR counter is not zero…..
- user prompted to guess a letter
- input received must be tested against letters in the word
- IF : no match, then a counter -1; (if started at 4 fields, output “You have 3 guesses left”)
- IF : yes match, reveal the match(es) on the screen
- Prompt for next letter choice
- 

———
- IF counter is zero - “output you LOST”
- ELSE “you WON”

————————

Tests:

- word is chosen randomly by computer from the word array
    - start with one word in word array
    - then test multiple words in random way (possibly all three words have same number of letters each)
- terminal displays correct number of characters
    - start with a single-letter word
    - then small word like “is” or “hat”
    - then longer words
- test to find match for letters in word vs. input from test
- display the match, give count for remaining turns
- test if not a match
    - should decrement count of remaining turns and display this
- test for continued prompts
- test for LOSE condition being met
- test for WIN condition being met
- test the outcome determined - win or lose





- send method 2 arguments — original word, and chosen letter.
- output should be all dashes (same length of word), but replace dashes when instances of chosen letter are present





public String replaceLetters(String inputWord, String guessedLetters) {
	String outputWord = “”;
	//create a new Array out of guessedLetters - each element is one of the letters

	for(int k=0; k < guessLettersArray.length(); k++) {
		for(int i=0; inputWord.length(); i++) {
			if (inputWord.regionMatches(i, guessLettersArray[k], 0, guessLettersArray[k].length())
				guessLettersArray[k]
